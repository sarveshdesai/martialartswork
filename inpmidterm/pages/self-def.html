        <h1>What is self defence?<h1>
       <h2>To understand why training for self-defense is important, it helps to understand what it entails. Self-defense is the training and techniques necessary to defend yourself when targeted by crime or violence. There will always be thieves who want to take what isn’t theirs, and predators who want to hurt or humiliate others. When you train in self-defense, you gain the tools to stay safe from danger.</h2>

            <h1>How to escape a standing rear choke<h1>
           <h2>1. Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight forward, making it more difficult for your attacker to pick you up.<br> 2. It also gives you a better angle to throw elbows from side to side to the attacker’s face.<br>
             Turn into the attacker with one of your elbows and continue counterattacking.<br>
             3.This should give you space to turn fully, using another move to injure the face or strike the groin. With the space these moves have created, you may be able to escape and run away.</h2>
