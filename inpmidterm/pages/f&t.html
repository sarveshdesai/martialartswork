        <h1>Fighting Techniques to Practice at Your Home<h1>
       <h2>Improving your fighting techniques at home can be difficult without a training partner, equipment such as exercise mats and enough space for large movements such as sweeps. But short-range movements such as strikes and kicks while standing in place are fighting techniques you can practice at home with minimal space. Repetition of any movement helps your body learn to do it more easily and quickly, making you a better fighter. Instead of trying to learn all the techniques at once, work on perfecting a few.</h2>

        <h1>Punching<h1>
       <h2>Any fighter knows strong, quick punches are one of the keys to defeating opponents. Incorrect punching technique may result in a broken hand or wrist in a fighting situation. Therefore, practicing until you have the correct form not only increases your strength and power, but also reduces your chances of injury. To practice punches at home, stand in front a mirror so you can watch your form. Bring your hands up in fighting position in front of your chest or face and then slowly rotate your right forearm as you extend it forward at head height. At the end of the punch, your arm is straight with your palm facing the floor and the wrist straight. Repeat with the left hand.</h2>
